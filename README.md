# Introduction

`xmppconsole` goal is to be raw and simple, but very handy XMPP client for Unix
command-line.

Readline library is used in a neat way to server asynchronous display
(see ./src/io.c). It looks very nice, really - clean and simple.

Libstrophe library is used to handle XMPP communication.

# Status

It's fresh and new. Please expect bugs. The code is a subject of
heavy and constant changes.
